	<h2>JavaScript Class Method</h2>

	<p>Demonstration of how to add a method in a JavaScript Class.</p>

	<p id="demo"></p>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		
		class Car {
			constructor(brand,model,year) {
				this.carname = brand;
				this.model = model;
				this.year = year;
			}
			present(question) {
				return question + "I have a " + this.carname + " " + this.model + " which is " + this.year + " model";
			}
		}

		mycar = new Car("Honda","Fit",2006);

		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = mycar.present("Which car you are using? ");

	<!-- A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.Use the keyword class to create a class, and always add the constructor() method.The constructor method is called each time the class object is initialized.The constructor method is special, it is where you initialize properties, it is called automatically when a class is initiated, and it has to have the exact name "constructor", in fact, if you do not have a constructor method, JavaScript will add an invisible and empty constructor method. -->
