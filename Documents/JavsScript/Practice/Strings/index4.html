    //Extracting Charcters
    // charAt(position) method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:

    var name = "Krishna";
    document.write("The character at position 4 is " + name.charAt(4) + "</br>"); //returns h 
    //If no character is found, charAt() returns an empty string.
    document.write("The character at position 10 is " + name.charAt(10) + "</br>"); //returns nothing 
    //charCodeAt(position) method returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string:
    document.write("The unicode of the character at position 4 is " + name.charCodeAt(4) + "</br>");
    //Property access [ ] ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings:
    document.write("The property at the position 1 is " + name[1] + "</br>");
   /* Property access might be a little unpredictable:
    It does not work in Internet Explorer 7 or earlier
    It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
    If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
    It is read only. name[0] = "K" gives no error (but does not work!)*/
